This project involved designing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze year-to-date 
(YTD) car sales trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for sales performance, pricing, and dealer 
region strategies. Key metrics tracked included total sales, average selling price (ASP), and units sold, with 
comparisons to the previous year. The dashboard featured regional sales analysis through map visualizations, 
company-wise sales trends, and market share breakdowns for various brands. Visuals such as line graphs, pie 
charts, and detailed sales tables provided insights into weekly sales trends, consumer preferences by car 
body style and color, and granular sales data. As a result, the sales team identified high-demand models and 
optimized pricing strategies, leading to a 23.59% improvement in overall sales efficiency YTD
